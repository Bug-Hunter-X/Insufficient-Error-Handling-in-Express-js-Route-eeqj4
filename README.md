# Insufficient Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios such as invalid user IDs or users not being found in the database.

The improved version (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates best practices for handling these scenarios, including more informative error messages, appropriate HTTP status codes, and centralized error handling for better maintainability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Notice the lack of robust error responses.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.

## Key Improvements in the Solution

* **Explicit Error Handling:** Uses `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
* **Specific HTTP Status Codes:** Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500) for different error conditions.
* **Informative Error Messages:** Provides clear and user-friendly error messages instead of generic 'Internal Server Error'.
* **Centralized Error Handling:**  (Could be implemented further for larger apps) This makes error handling more manageable and consistent.
* **Input Validation:** (Could be added) Consider adding input validation to prevent invalid user IDs from being passed to the database query.
